# world-cheese-awards-analysis
A cheesy analysis of the 2021 World Cheese Awards website, ranking over 1,700 entries from many competitors all over the world.

## Just why ?
As a fellow french-cheese enjoyer, I am often discovering new cheese, flavors and thus new reasons like countries.
But what if France was not the best in this *ancestral* domain ? What if Switzerland was better ranked ? Even if I have to admit, I really like their cheese.  

Not being able to suffer from this ignorance -fearing the worst for my beloved french cheese-, I decided to make up this fun project.

## Dataset

## Going further
I will maybe if I could do something fun using machine learning techniques.
