# world-cheese-awards-analysis
A cheesy analysis of the 2021 World Cheese Awards website, ranking over 1,700 entries from many competitors all over the world.

## Just why ?
As a fellow **french-cheese enjoyer**, I am often discovering new cheese, flavors and thus new reasons like countries.
But what if France was not the best in this *ancestral* domain ? What if Switzerland was better ranked ? Even if I have to admit, I really like their cheese.  

Not being able to suffer from this ignorance -fearing the worst for my beloved french cheese-, I decided to make up this fun project.

## Dataset
Dataset taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ericsims/world-cheese-awards-worlds-cheesiest-dataset?select=world_cheese_awards_2021.csv). Follow the link for more details about the dataset.  

### How to get it
I used the `opendataset` python library to directly download it from my jupyter notebook code.

## ML ? Isn't that just a buzzword to boost your career ?
Maybe, maybe not. What a cheezy comment anyway.

On a more serious note : I want to play a bit and see if I could do something fun using machine learning techniques. Who knows, maybe there's actually something useful to extract beyond the fun ?  

For now, I have some ideas :
- Make some predictions for the next years results (2022 and more),
- Predict a cheese rank outcome,
- Automatically assign new cheese contestants in their category,
- Predict cheese trends in countries (this may need sales datasets to cross with !),
- etc...
