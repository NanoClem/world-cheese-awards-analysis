# world-cheese-awards-analysis
A cheesy analysis of the 2021 World Cheese Awards website, ranking over 1,700 entries from many competitors all over the world.

## Just why ?
As a fellow **french-cheese enjoyer**, I am often discovering new cheese, flavors and thus new reasons like countries.
But what if France was not the best in this *ancestral* domain ? What if Switzerland was better ranked ? Even if I have to admit, I really like their cheese.  

Not being able to suffer from this ignorance -fearing the worst for my beloved french cheese-, I decided to make up this fun project.

## Dataset
Taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ericsims/world-cheese-awards-worlds-cheesiest-dataset?select=world_cheese_awards_2021.csv). Follow the link for more details about the dataset.

### How to get it
I used the [kaggle](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) python library to directly download the dataset from my jupyter notebook code. Instructions are in the notebook.  
This is completely optional, you can directly download it and put it in the *data/* folder.  

## What's next ? Machine learning ? Isn't that just a buzzword to boost your career ?
Maybe, maybe not. What a cheezy comment anyway.

On a more serious note : I want to play a bit and see if I could do something fun using machine learning techniques. Who knows, maybe there's actually something useful to extract beyond the fun ? I will certainly need more data, maybe scraping next years results would be a good idea.

For now, I have some ideas :
- Predict a cheese rank outcome (classification),
- Automatically assign new cheese contestants in their category (classification),
- Predict cheese trends in countries (this may need sales datasets to cross with !)
